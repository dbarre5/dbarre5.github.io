									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>Reliability of blowout preventers (BOPs) is crucial for drilling and production operations. Erosion of BOP components and hydrodynamic forces on rams may cause failure of BOP elements to seal the well. Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of fluids within the wellbore and BOP offer quantitative and qualitative data related to this reliability during the closure of various BOP components. Since limited research has been published in transient CFD simulations of closing BOPs, this thesis discusses challenges and solutions to simulating closing blowout preventers. Single component fluids are simulated through several BOP geometries such as annular preventers, pipe rams, and shear rams. Cavitation, pressure fields, velocity fields, and shear rates along walls are monitored during the simulations. The present work provides a basis to which future directions may be built upon, such as more complex fluid properties.</p>
