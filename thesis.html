									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>Reliability of blowout preventers (BOPs) is crucial for drilling and production operations. Erosion of BOP components and hydrodynamic forces on rams may cause failure of BOP elements to seal the well. Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of fluids within the wellbore and BOP offer quantitative and qualitative data related to this reliability during the closure of various BOP components. Since limited research has been published in transient CFD simulations of closing BOPs, this thesis discusses challenges and solutions to simulating closing blowout preventers. Single component fluids are simulated through several BOP geometries such as annular preventers, pipe rams, and shear rams. Cavitation, pressure fields, velocity fields, and shear rates along walls are monitored during the simulations. The present work provides a basis to which future directions may be built upon, such as more complex fluid properties.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Introduction/Background</h3>
									<p>During the drilling process, influx of fluid from a formation may occur into the wellbore. Influx of fluid may occur for many reasons, such as an insufficient pressure provided by the drilling fluid. In cases as these, a blowout preventer (BOP) may be closed to control the well. A BOP is essentially a series of valves located at the top of a well that serves as a secondary means of controlling the well. An illustration of a BOP stack with labeled components is provided in Figure 1.  A BOP consists of various sealing mechanisms such as pipe rams, shear rams, and an annular preventer. Each of these components can be investigated separately through simulation.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Challenges for simulation closing blowout preventers</h3>
									<p>Many challenges exist when simulating fluid flow through closing blowout preventers. Not all challenges are solved in this thesis work, but this section is an overview of some of the main challenges. One issue with simulating closing blowout preventers is that extreme deformations will occur in the meshes. Because of these extreme deformations, remeshing of the computational domain must be done throughout the entire simulation. Some remeshing strategies to maintain a high quality mesh will be described later.</p>
